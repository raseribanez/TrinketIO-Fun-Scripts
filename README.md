# TrinketIO-Fun-Scripts
Other fun stuff from the TrinketIO site - these are little turtle drawings and other art in Python

I was following a tutorial online where I learned about the Turtle package in Pyhton. Most of the scripts here are based on the Turtle package, but also some other Python artwork related things too

I joined the cool site called Trinket-io where youupload little samples of code and test them using their online code engine. It is like a mini Github aimed at kids to teach them about coding, and also sharing code in an open source way.

After I uploaded a few things I decided to keep them altogether so created a repository for others to use them if needed!

Theres a few things here that are not my own writing, although I did personally rewrite every single one, some were done as tutorial exercises
